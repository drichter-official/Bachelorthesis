## 📖 **Overview**  
This repository contains my **Bachelor Thesis in Physics**, where I explore the use of **machine learning models** for reconstructing ultrafast **laser pulse properties** in **transient absorption spectroscopy**. The study compares different **supervised learning techniques**, including **decision trees, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, to reconstruct pulse characteristics from absorption spectra under varying noise levels.

## 🧑‍🔬 **Research Summary**  
- **Simulated ultrashort laser pulses** interacting with a quantum system using a numerical **few-level model**.  
- **Generated absorption spectra datasets** with varying pulse parameters and **Gaussian noise levels** to train ML models.  
- **Implemented and compared multiple ML models** to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing pulse parameters.  
- **Analyzed model performance** using evaluation metrics like **R²-score** and **error distributions**.  

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)  
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** (Regression Models, MLP, CNN)  
- **Numerical Simulations** (Few-level quantum systems, Absorption Spectroscopy)
